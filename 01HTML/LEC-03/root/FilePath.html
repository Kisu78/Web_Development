<!-- Relative Path :Means A path relative to the current fileâ€™s location.-->

<!--******************* Why Relative URL Cannot Go Beyond Your Folder into System Files ************* -->

<!-- Relative paths (../) only move inside your project folder structure. -->
<!-- When you try to go outside (beyond project root) â†’ the browser blocks it for security reasons. -->
<!-- ðŸ‘‰ Browser will not allow it because:
    Security: Websites are sandboxed. They cannot read your system files (Windows, C drive, etc.), otherwise any site could steal your personal data.
    Project Root: Browsers treat your project folder as the root, so ../ beyond that is ignored or blocked. -->






<!-- Absolute Path :A complete path from the root (or full URL).
    Does not depend on HTML file location.-->
<!-- Absolute path is like giving the complete address from the very beginning. -->
<!-- Real World Example:
        Like if i Am living in Ahembadad and someone ask to me give location of bus stand 
        so i Say him to go Earth then go to india in gujrat state go to ahemdabad then go to maniagar then your bus stand is come -->
