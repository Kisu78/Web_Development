<!-- A boilerplate in HTML means the basic standard code template that is used at the start of every HTML document. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="This is a sample HTML boilerplate">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


<!-- 1. <!DOCTYPE html>
    Purpose: Tells the browser which version of HTML is used.
    Here, <!DOCTYPE html> means HTML5.
    Without it, browsers may use quirks mode, rendering inconsistently. 
-->

<!--    
2. <html lang="en">
    It is a Root element: Everything goes inside <html>...</html>.
    Attribute:
        lang="en" → Declares the language Of the Document(English). 
        Helps SEO and screen readers.
 -->

<!-- 
3. <head> ... </head>
    Contains metadata (information about the page, not shown directly).
        Common elements inside <head>:

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        Sets character encoding to UTF-8.
        Supports almost all languages, symbols, and emojis.
        Without it, special characters may display incorrectly.

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            Use:Makes page responsive on mobile devices.
            width=device-width → Matches the screen width of the device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
            initial-scale=1.0 → Sets zoom level to 100% by default(Defulat zoom level)

        <meta name="description" content="...">
            Short description of the page.
            Used by search engines (SEO).

        <title>My Website</title>
            Title shown in the browser tab.
            Very important for SEO.

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
            Connects an external CSS file.
            Attributes: rel="stylesheet" → It Describe a Relationship that is a stylesheet.

        -->


<!-- 4. <body> ... </body>

    Includes text, images, links, forms, etc. 
-->


<!-- 
5. <script src="./script.js"></script>
    Links an external JavaScript file.
    Attributes:src="script.js" → Path to JS file.
    Placement:At end of body → Better performance (script loads after HTML).
 -->


<!-- 
If We Don’t Use It

<!DOCTYPE html> → Browser may switch to quirks mode, and page may look broken or old-style.

<html lang="en"> → Page still works, but screen readers and Google SEO may not understand language.

<head> → Without it, you can’t add metadata, styles, or scripts properly.

<meta charset="UTF-8"> → Some symbols, emojis, or non-English letters may show as weird boxes/???.

<meta name="viewport" ...> → Page will look zoomed out or tiny on mobile phones.

<meta name="description" ...> → Search engines won’t know what your page is about → bad SEO ranking.

<title> → Browser tab will just say “Untitled”.

<link rel="stylesheet" ...> → No external CSS, so page looks plain black-and-white.

<body> → You cannot show any real content; nothing will appear.

<script src="..."> → Your JavaScript won’t run, so page won’t have interactivity. 

-->
    



<!-- Main Point if We dont use BoilerPlate so Browser Automatic Write Our Content into BoilerPlate
    But But this is not correct HTML. Some browsers or tools may not handle it properly 
-->
<!-- 
Why <body> is needed?
    Keeps code organized → everything visible goes in one place.
    Required for valid HTML (W3C standards).
    Some scripts and CSS only work properly if content is inside <body> 
-->
