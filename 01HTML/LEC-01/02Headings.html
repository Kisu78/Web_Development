<!-- ðŸ“Œ HTML Headings: -->
<!-- Headings in HTML are used to define titles or subtitles in a webpage.
    They are written using heading tags: <h1> to <h6>.
    <h1> is the highest (largest) level, and <h6> is the lowest (smallest).
 -->

<!-- 
<h1> should be used only once per page (main topic).
<h2>, <h3>, etc., can be used multiple times to organize content. 
-->

<!-- Headings create a hierarchical structure for your webpage, just like chapters in a book.
    Always Use Like First h1 After h2 
    And Dont Use Like h2 h1 h4 h2 h1  -->
<h1>Web Development Course</h1>
<h2>Web Development Course</h2>
<h3>Web Development Course</h3>
<h4>Web Development Course</h4>
<h5>Web Development Course</h5>

<!-- Key Points to Remember:
    <h1> to <h6> â†’ Six levels of headings.
    <h1> is most important, <h6> is least important.
    Good for readability and SEO.
    Donâ€™t use headings just for making text bigger â€” use CSS for styling.
    Follow a hierarchy (like outline of a book).
