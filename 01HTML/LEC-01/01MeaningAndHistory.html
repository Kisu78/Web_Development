🌐 What is HTML?

Full Form: HyperText Markup Language

Meaning:

    It is the standard markup language used to create webpages.

    "Hypertext" means linking one document to another through links (hyperlinks).

    "Markup" means we use tags (like <p>, <h1>, <a>, etc.) to mark up text so that the browser knows how to display it.

    "Language" means it has its own rules and structure, but it is not a programming language. It is a markup language.

    👉 So, HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes it interactive.

1.HTML Tag
A tag is just the instruction inside angle brackets < >.
It tells the browser how to treat the content

Most tags come in pairs:
Opening tag → <p>
Closing tag → </p>
Some are self-closing (no end tag): <br>, <hr>, <img>


2.HTML Element
An element = Opening tag + Content + Closing tag.


3.HTML Comment
Used to write notes in code that are ignored by the browser.
