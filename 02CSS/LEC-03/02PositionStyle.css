

/* position property controls how elements are placed on the page.
 relative to the normal flow, their parent, or the viewport.

1. static (Default)
    This is the default value.
    The element is positioned normally in the document flow (top to bottom).
    No effect from top, left, right, or bottom. 
2. relative
    The element stays in the normal flow, but you can move it using top, left, right, or bottom.
    The space it originally occupied is still reserved.
3. absolute
    The element is removed from the normal flow.
    Itâ€™s positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
    If none found, it positions relative to the <html> or body.
4. fixed
    Removed from the normal flow.
    Always positioned relative to the viewport (browser window).
    Does not move when you scroll.  
5. sticky
    Acts like relative until a scroll threshold is met, then behaves like fixed.
    Sticks to a position while scrolling, relative to its parent container.
