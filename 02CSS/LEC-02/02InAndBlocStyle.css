/* Inline And Block Level Element */
 /* 1. Block Elements */
/* Always start on a new line. */
/* Take up the full width available (stretch across the container), even if content is small. */
/* Can contain other block and inline elements. */
/* You can set width, height, margin, padding normally. */
/* Example: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <form> */

/* 2. Inline Elements */
/* Do not start on a new line. */
/* Only take up as much width as their content needs. */
/* They can sit side by side with other inline elements. */
/* You cannot set width and height directly (they shrink to content). */
/* Margins and paddings work only horizontally (left/right), not vertically. */
/* Exmaple: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <img>, <label>, <small>, <mark> */

    margin: 0;

    width: 30px;
    margin: 20px;
    padding: 5px;
    border: 5px solid black;

    /* When We Give padding to inline element like span then padding apply to all sides 
       But It only a Visual effect not really padding apply 
       For Prove
        If We Give padding to Block level then content is move
        but in line content is not move and stay at their location */

    /* For Better Ans ChatGBT
        Because the background color paints the content + padding box, so when you add padding (all sides) on an inline element, the background extends with it.
        ðŸ‘‰ But for margin:
        Left/Right margin works normally.
        Top/Bottom margin exists but has no visual effect (it doesnâ€™t push lines apart).

| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| New line?      | Yes (start on new line) | No (stay in same line)                     |
| Width          | Full width of container | Only as wide as content                    |
| Height         | Can set with CSS        | Depends on content (canâ€™t set directly)    |
